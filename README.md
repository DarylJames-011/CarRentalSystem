The Car Rental System made by Daryl James is designed to streamline car rental operations for car rental owners. The database itself is added to a separate file, which is on Google Drive. It has core features such as vehicle management, payment handling, adding or editing reservations, client management, and admin management, which are exclusive only to the Owner Role. Several Nice-to-have features are also added to give the program a realistic feel compared to the business car rental system.
